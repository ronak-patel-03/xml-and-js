Question 4: 
    DTD: It defines the structure with list of elements and attributes of an XML document. An XML document can contain an inline or external recommendation DTD declaration. Its declaration is like a tree, first root element then inside elements, attributes and their types. It is easy to declare DTD.

    XSD: It is XML Schema Definition which describes the structure of an XML document. It is mostly used to specify what kinds of elements, properties, and data the document can contain.
    XSD is hard to do or understand as compared to DTD.
